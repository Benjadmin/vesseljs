Propellers are linearized from Kt, Kq curves for expected working regime (that is, high efficiency region of the curves) with:
	Kt = beta1 - beta2\*J
	Kq = gamma1 - gamma2\*J

Suggestions for improvement in the future:
* approximate curves with higher order polynomials.
* create a script to automatically generate propeller specifications.
* create a propeller constructor/prototype with methods for controlling pitch.
